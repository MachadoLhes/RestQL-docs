# Getting Started

## Running restQL HTTP

restQL Server allows you to post ad-hoc queries and to reference resources pre-configured in the server startup.

1. Download the latest release in the [release page](https://github.com/B2W-BIT/restQL-http/releases),
2. Unzip the package,
3. Edit the file env.sh with the resources you want to invoke,
3. Run bin/run.sh.

Post to http://your-server.ip:9000/run-query the body below and content-type text/plain:

```clojure
curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:9000/run-query -d "from planets as allPlanets" 
```

If you want to know more about the **query language**, [click here](/restql/queryLang.md)

## Your first query

Here's a basic example of what a restQL query should look like:

```
from planets
    with id = 1
```
**Note:** on this example, we use [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co) for educational purposes. The `planets` resource leads to `https://swapi.co/api/planets/:id`

from which you get the response:
```json
{
  "planets": {
    "details": {
      "success": true,
      "status": 200,
      "metadata": {}
    },
    "result": {
      "surface_water": "1",
