# Tutorial

Hello, hero! We are glad you wanna try out restQL to save the universe! Do you have what it takes to use the mighty powers of this tool? Don't worry, this tutorial will be your guide! RestQL is quite simple, you should take less effort than snapping your fingers and turning half of the universe population into dust, this won't take long.

In this tutorial you'll learn how you can query a RESTful API (in this case, the [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)), build your project locally.

This tutorial is freely inspired by [Apollo GraphQL's tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction), thanks for the inspiration, buddies! Also, thanks for making all this real data available, [SpaceX](https://docs.spacexdata.com/), you guys rock!

## System Requirements
As prerequisites to build restQL-http from source we need:

- Java 11
- Leiningen 

## Preparing for Battle
Simply clone the project from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/B2W-BIT/restQL-http) and create a file called `restql.yml` at `/src/resources/`, we'll get there soon.

We also recommend using a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
