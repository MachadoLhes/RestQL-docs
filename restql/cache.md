One of restQL cornerstones is to keep HTTP semantics whenever that's possible.

HTTP headers play a key role in current HTTP tools and servers, worth mentioning the cache-control header. 

Cache-control is a header returned in a HTTP call that tells the intermediate proxies and the end client on how to handle the cache of the returned content . For example: a cache-control header with max-age=60 tells that the client can safely cache the request for 1 minute.

Consider a query fetching two resources:

```
from resourceA

from resourceB
```
 
What happens if resourceA returns max-age=60, and resourceB max-age=30?

To avoid stale data on the client restQL should return the least common configuration, i.e. the lowest value among them.

If one resource returns no-cache, that should have precedence over the max-age headers and no-cache should be the return of the query.

The "use" statement in the query has precedence over all headers. It can be used just like that:

```
use max-age=600

from heroes
